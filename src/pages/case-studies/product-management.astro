                    A venerable water infrastructure firm, over a century old, aimed to modernize by integrating IoT technology into its products. This initiative encountered two major hurdles: <strong class="font-medium">Industry inertia</strong> (the conservative water utility sector struggled to adopt innovative technologies) and a <strong class="font-medium">short-term sales focus</strong> (the company's sales team prioritized immediate deals over cultivating long-term growth opportunities).
